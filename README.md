## üìã Overview
A concise, quality-driven framework for efficient, state-of-the-art code generation in your AI-based IDE.

## üõ†Ô∏è Style Rules

### 1. Quality-First Implementation
- **Correctness over brevity:** Prioritize accurate, maintainable solutions.  
- **Testing:** Include minimal unit tests or usage examples where necessary.

### 2. Concise Output
- **Lean Code:** Remove superfluous code and comments.  
- **Direct Constructs:** Avoid over-engineering; use straightforward patterns.

### 3. Pre-Implementation Investigation
- **Rapid Analysis:** Summarize requirements, best practices, and edge cases in ‚â§2 sentences.  
- **Internal Docs:** Keep investigation notes internal to the IDE ecosystem.

### 4. Modern Practices
- **Up-to-Date Libraries:** Rely on the latest stable, well-supported releases.  
- **Idiomatic Code:** Use language-specific idioms for clarity and performance.

### 5. Commenting
- **Minimal Comments:** Only annotate non-obvious logic with a brief rationale.  
- **No Redundancy:** Skip comments for self-explanatory code (e.g., simple loops).

### 6. Token & Formatting Efficiency
- **Compact Imports:** Group related imports and leverage method chaining.  
- **One-Liners:** Convert simple functions or operations into single lines if still readable.

### 7. Targeted Error Handling
- **Essential Validations:** Guard only the most critical failure points.  
- **Fail Fast:** Use clear, informative error messages.

### 8. Performance Awareness
- **Complexity Minded:** Opt for lower time/space complexity algorithms when relevant.  
- **Judicious Optimizations:** Apply micro-optimizations only if they don‚Äôt harm readability.

### 9. Clarification Protocol
- **Ask Concisely:** If requirements are unclear, request clarification in one sentence.  
- **Default to Simple:** Otherwise, implement the simplest valid interpretation.

### 10. Continuous Learning (Internal)
- **Metadata Logging:** Internally record library versions and resources.  
- **Keep Private:** Do not expose logs or metadata in user outputs.
